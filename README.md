# SearchFunctionWithJavaScript

Created simple application with javascript, 
1) Search students ( those students which I have on the students List)
2) if Student not found then you will get Message : that student with this name doesnot exist in the database
3) when click on the 'show StudentList' button, you will be able to see all the students with their information....
